				<h1>BISTDoc: Docs You Need!</h1>

				<article>
					<p>
						Hi! This website holds documents that you are gonna need during   your semesters at college. Remember the last time you were trying to   find someone who will give you the practicals. Well in the 21st century   just download things you need from this website and if they are not   there just add a request. I will look into it and provide it for you.   Also anybody from college and of any branch who want to distribute any   documents among their peers can use the website as a tool too.

					<h2>Update on new year 2016</h2>
					<p>
						The template based interface has been replaced by a new one powered by everyone's favourite library Bootstrap.
					</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>The New Interface</h2>
					<p>The site previously had a little stale interface. But now that its on google I have quickly refreshed it to a new one.</p>
				</article>

					<h2>THE SITE HAS GONE GOOGLE !</h2>
				  <p>I have done a major change and that is to shift from hpage.com to Google's cloud platform. Hpage was really proving to be a pain to manage. I wanted to give the site my own design instead of preset one and it was a headache to do that on that freedomain site so I switched immediately to Google's servers the moment I came to know you can host your site on them. And now managing the site has been reduced to just two clicks. </p>
